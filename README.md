# Quiz-application-crypto-wip-

This is a project that I am working on that implements web 3 through the use of a quiz system somewhat similar to Freerice https://freerice.com/. 
The system runs upon how many questions the students get right. The number of questions the students get right is equivelent to how many satoshis
get donated to the Charities. This is similar to the rice system implemented into Freerice.com .
